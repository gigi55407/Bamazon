# Bamazon

Bamazon is an SQL and Node purchasing app consisting of a Customer module and a Manager module.

The Customer module enables the user to display all items that are available for purchase and to place orders.
When the user places an order, the module displays the name of the item ordered, the quantity ordered, the price for each item and the total price.

The Manager module enables the user to view all stock, view the items that are low in inventory (less than 5 available), restock an item, and add a new item.
